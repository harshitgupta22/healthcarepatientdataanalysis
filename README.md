## Project Description

- This is a collaborative project, constructed within a span of 5 days during the Construct Week of Block 35 of Masai School, consisting a total of 5 members.
- The objective of this Healthcare Patient Data Analysis project is to analyze synthetic patient data to identify trends in disease diagnosis and treatment outcomes. This analysis aims to provide insights that can help healthcare providers improve patient care and treatment strategies.
- Furthermore, the project endeavors to scrutinize trends in disease diagnosis, medications for patient, tests and treatment outcomes.

## Introduction

This project endeavors to scrutinize trends in disease diagnosis, medications for patient, tests and treatment outcomes and present recommendations to enhance the patient's medication. The primary dataset for this analysis was obtained through the datasets.

**Data Collection:**
- Description: The data was collected from Synthea website that provides information about patients, disease and severity, tests and medications.
- Process: All available data within the specified date range was successfully retrieved.
- Applications : Jupyter notebook(for python code), My SQL(for connecting dataset and cleaning process)

## Challenges

During the course of this project, we faced several challenges:

1. **Data Collection**: Synthetic datasets were not fully reflect real-world data variability. Synthea dataset was also not available, manually data collection.

2. **Data integration and Schema Design**: Combining datasets from different sources while maintaining data integrity and consistency was complex. Creating an effective schema that outlines the relationships between various tables and attributes was crucial for accurate analysis.

3. **Technical Implementation**: Establishing a seamless connection between SQL databases and Power BI without importing data requires technical expertise. Ensuring efficient data retrieval and query performance was challenging, especially with large datasets.

4. **Visualization Design**: Designing intuitive and informative dashboards in Power BI requires careful consideration of visualizations, layout, and interactivity. Balancing aesthetics with functionality while effectively communicating insights was challenging.


## Dashboard

We've developed an interactive dashboard using PowerBI to present and explore the key discoveries and insights derived from our analysis. 
The dashboard offers a user-friendly interface for navigating through the data, visualizing trends in disease diagnosis, and comprehending the treatment outcomes for various diseases. 
Feel free to explore the dashboard for a more engaging and interactive experience.

## Insights
- We have taken insights among distrubution of disease of patients.
- Distribution of symptoms and required tests for that.
- The patient with the county.


## Conclusion
- Insightful Analysis: Through the utilization of synthetic patient data and supplemental datasets, we were able to conduct a comprehensive analysis of disease diagnosis and treatment outcomes. This analysis provided valuable insights into trends and patterns that can help healthcare providers enhance patient care and treatment strategies. 
- Data Quality and Integration: Thorough data cleaning and schema design enabled us to effectively manage and integrate disparate datasets. This facilitated a holistic understanding of patient demographics, diagnoses, and treatments.
- Continuous Improvement: As with any data analysis project, there is always room for improvement. Moving forward, we can explore advanced analytics techniques, such as predictive modeling and machine learning, to uncover deeper insights and enhance decision-making in healthcare settings.


Overall, this project demonstrated the value of leveraging data-driven approaches to improve patient care and treatment strategies. By overcoming various challenges and leveraging the power of data visualization and analysis, we can drive positive outcomes in healthcare delivery and patient outcomes.
